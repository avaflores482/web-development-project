        <h1>Effects of Cookies</h1>
        <h2>security implications</h2>
        <p id="security">When your information is stored in cookies, all the data is visible to, and can be changed by the end user. If your 
            cookies are misused, for example sent to domain they shouldn’t be or accessed by bad actors. The potential consequences of this can 
            range anywhere from apps/websites not working or exhibiting strange behavior to a criminal stealing a session ID using it to set a 
            cookie that makes it look like they are logged In as someone else, allowing them to gain access to a bank or ecommerce account. 
            Monitoring your cookies settings and keeping track of which sites access your data can help protect you from these consequences.</p>
        
        <h2>enabling and removing cookies</h2>
        <div id="enabling">
            <p>While some cookies are dangerous, others may help optimize your browsing experience. You can limit what cookies end up on your 
                devices by enabling and disabling cookies on the websites you visit and on your browser.</p>
            <p>Here are the typical steps to allowing cookies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find the cookies section- usually under setting privacy</li>
                <li>Click the boxes to allow cookies. Sometimes the option says, allow “local” data</li>
                <li>If you don’t want cookies, you can simply uncheck these boxes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you would like to remove or change your browser cookies, you can follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find the Settings, Privacy section – sometimes listed under Tools, Internet Options, or Advanced.</li>
                <li>Follow the prompts on the available options to manage or remove cookies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you want to protect yourself even further, you might consider investing in a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that will route 
                your web connection through a remote server, posing as you. Cookies collected will be labeled for that remote server in  another 
                country instead of your personal computer.</p>
