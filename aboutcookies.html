        <h2>all about cookies</h2>
        <p id="aboutcookies">A cookie is a small piece of data a server will send to a user's web browser. The browser will store, modify, or create new 
            cookies and later send them back to the server with requests. Cookies allow web application to store limited amounts of data and remember state 
            information.</p>

        <h2>how cookies are used</h2>
        <div class="cookieuse">
            
            <p>A server will typically use cookies to figure out if different requests are coming from the same browser or user and subsequently issues a 
                personalized or generic response as deemed appropriate.<br>
                A typical user sign-in system would start with a user sending sign-in credentials 
                to the server using a form submission. If the credentials are correct, the server updates the UI to indicate that the user was signed in and 
                responds with a cookie containing a session ID that records their sign-in status on the browser. If a user moves to a different page on the 
                same site, the browser will send the cookie with the session ID along with the request to indicate that it still thinks the user is signed in. 
                The server then checks the session ID, and if it’s still valid, sends the user to a personalized version of the page they moved to. If the 
                session ID is no longer valid it will be deleted, and the user will be shown a generic version of the page or they may be asked to sign in again.<br></p>
            
            <p><b>The three main uses of cookies:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>session management:</b> used for things like user sign-in status, shopping cart contents, game scores, or any other session-related 
                    details the server would need to remember</li>
                <li><b>personalization:</b> user preferences like display language and UI theme like dark or light mode</li>
                <li><b>tracking:</b> recording and anlayzing user behavior</li>
            </ul>
            
        </div>

        <h2>different types of cookies</h2>
        
        <div class="cookietypes">
            <p>The two main types of cookies are session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>
            <p><b>Session cookies</b> are only used while navigating a website. They are stored in random access memory but aren’t written to the hard 
                drive. Once the session ends, the cookies are automatically deleted. The browser defines when the “current session” ends, and some browsers 
                use session restoring when restarted. This can cause session cookies to last indefinitely. These types of cookies also help make the back 
                button on your browser work.</p>
            <p><b>Persistent cookies</b> remain on a computer for an indefinite period of time. Many, however, have expiration dates that dictate when 
                the data is deleted. Persistent cookies can be used for authentication which tracks whether a user is logged in, as well as login 
                information, so a user doesn’t have to remember passwords. Persistent cookies are also used for tracking how many times a user visits a 
                website. Some websites use cookies to track pages and products customers look at in order to suggest new items to them in the future.<br></p>
            <p>Cookies can be broken down further into first-party cookies and third-party cookies.</p>
            <p><b>First-party cookies</b> are created by the site you are using and generally safer, as long as you are browsing secure sites that 
                have not been recently compromised.</p>
            <p><b>Essential cookies</b> are first-party session cookies that are necessary to run the website you are trying to access.</p>
            <p><b>Third-party cookies</b> are more dangerous. As you may be able to tell from the name, they are generated by third party websites, usually 
                linked by ads to the page you are actually browsing. Third-party cookies allow advertisers or analytic companies to track a user’s 
                browsing history across any website that contains their ads. Thankfully, new data protection laws in most countries and states let a user 
                decide whether to allow third-party cookies to access their browser.</p>
            <p><b>Zombie cookies, </b>or supercookies, are another type of third-party, persistent cookie, that are permanently installed on a user’s 
                computer and are very difficult to remove. They, unlike other types of cookies, can reappear on your computer after they’ve been deleted 
                from your computer. They can be used by web analytics companies to track user’s browsing histories like other third-party cookies. They 
                can also be used to ban certain users from a website and prevent them from regaining access to that site.</p>
